# Data Science & Machine Learning with Python

This is a repository that contains a list of data mining and machine learning algorithms with python using <a href="https://www.continuum.io/why-anaconda">Anaconda platform</a>. There's also an entire section on machine learning with Apache Spark in order to scale up these techniques to big data analyzed on a computing cluster.

## Covered techniques 

The following techniques used by real data scientists in the tech industry:

* Regression analysis
* K-Means Clustering
* Principal Component Analysis
* Train/Test and cross validation
* Bayesian Methods
* Decision Trees and Random Forests
* Multivariate Regression
* Multi-Level Models
* Support Vector Machines
* Reinforcement Learning
* Collaborative Filtering
* K-Nearest Neighbor
* Bias/Variance Tradeoff
* Ensemble Learning
* Term Frequency / Inverse Document Frequency
* Experimental Design and A/B Tests

## Projects 

In order to practice these techniques I've built the following projects:

* Movie recommendation system using actual user rating data
* Search engine works for Wikipedia data
* Spam classifier

## Getting started with python

This is a <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/index.htm">tutorial</a> designed for software programmers who need to learn Python programming language from scratch.

## Statistics and Probability Refresher

* Mean, median, mode and introducing <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">numpy</a>, <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">scipy</a> and <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>
* Standard deviation, population and sample variance
* Data distributions
